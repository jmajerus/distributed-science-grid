# Distributed Science Grid

## üåê Vision

In a time when science funding is being cut and access to high-performance computing is limited to those with institutional or corporate backing, we propose a new direction: a distributed, community-powered computing framework designed to support global scientific research.

Inspired by the local orchestration model of software like **Tdarr**, and the legacy of global projects like **BOINC**, this project envisions a system where CPUs and GPUs across homes, schools, and labs are coordinated intelligently ‚Äî starting small (on a local network) and scaling to a global, ethical, open science grid.

## üéØ Purpose

To create an open infrastructure that enables:

- Researchers who lack access to institutional HPC or expensive cloud services
- Citizen scientists conducting meaningful work
- Students, classrooms, and labs with underutilized devices
- A community that believes computing should serve the public good

## üí° What's Different

Unlike traditional volunteer computing platforms, this project will explore:

- **LAN-first orchestration**, with real-time awareness of node capabilities
- **Smarter scheduling**, supporting pipelined and multi-stage tasks
- **Scalability** to wider federated networks or public opt-in systems
- **Openness and transparency** in governance, resource sharing, and task sourcing

We don‚Äôt intend to replace existing systems like BOINC ‚Äî we aim to complement and extend them with more flexible orchestration models.

## üìå Next Steps

1. **Research & Exploration**
   - Survey distributed computing frameworks (BOINC, Folding@home, HTCondor, Ray, etc.)
   - Learn from Kubernetes, Tdarr, Slurm, and orchestration tools
   - Gather use cases from researchers and open science communities

2. **Prototype a Local Orchestrator**
   - Build a small-scale LAN scheduler
   - Track available hardware (CPU/GPU, RAM, bandwidth)
   - Distribute and monitor jobs (e.g., media encoding, simulations)

3. **Develop Task & Workflow Models**
   - Explore different types of scientific tasks (parallel, pipelined, multi-step)
   - Define a lightweight job format and API

4. **Invite Collaborators**
   - Reach out to developers, scientists, and institutions who share the vision
   - Gather feedback and foster open discussion

## ü§ù Collaboration & Ethos

This project is exploratory and open. We're not experts in all aspects of distributed systems ‚Äî but we believe the idea has merit and deserves exploration. We welcome feedback, criticism, collaboration, or forking.

If you‚Äôd like to contribute, suggest improvements, or help shape the direction of this initiative, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
